Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) came into their own, as residential solar panels reclaimed their autonomy, liberating homes from the constraints of grid dependency.\n\nThe grid of the future heralds a symphony of innovation, from blockchain\u2019s pioneering security to the renewable symphony of wind and solar power. As we navigate the mists of the future, the interplay of these technological advancements will be key in charting the course of energy resilience and grid reliability. May the wisdom gleaned from the tribulations of the past decade serve as a guide for our path ahead, ensuring that the power of the people never falters and the lights never again falter.",
