Salt block grilling, a method that dates back to the time when Himalayan salts were first discovered, is at the forefront of this movement. On a crisp autumnal evening last September 15th, 2023, I encountered a story that emboldened my appreciation for this primeval method of cooking. \n\nA burgeoning community of food enthusiasts gathered around open flames and pink, preheated slabs of Himalayan salt block\u2014their surfaces sizzling with a variety of meats and vegetables. There was an air of cultivated antiquity infused with adventurous modern flair. \n\nThe Resurrection of an Ancient Cooking Technique \n\nOur gastronomic past is littered with techniques that have been refined or lost through the sands of time. The salt block grilling method is steeping infrequently in history, with evidence suggesting that people in the regions surrounding the Himalayas have used salt to preserve and cook food for centuries. \n\nIt wasn't until chefs like Francis Mallmann and food writers such as Mark Bitterman introduced the technique to a broader audience that we truly began to explore its potential once again. The recent emergence of this method is partly due to its simplistic nature, which allows for an interactive and theatrical cooking experience\u2014a story of fire, salt, and cuisine that even the most novice cooks can engage in. \n\nThe Basics of Salt Block Grilling \n\nAs the demand for experiential dining experiences amplifies, we're constantly searching for novel ways of presenting and flavoring our food. A salt block is precisely what it sounds like\u2014a large piece of pink salt, typically sourced from the Himalayas, that acts as a cooking surface. It imparts a subtle saltiness to food, an effect that can't be achieved with traditional cookware. \n\nBy September 18th, 2023, I found myself in the backyard of James and Deirdre McCarthy, a couple known among their friends for their adventurous culinary gatherings in Charleston, South Carolina. It was there I truly grasped the fundamentals of salt block grilling from James, a retired chef, and avid grilling aficionado. \n\n\"The salt block should be slowly heated,\" James explained, emphasizing the care needed to prevent the block from cracking due to thermal shock. \"You start with a low flame and\ngradually grow to high heat. A well-heated block can sear, saut\u00e9, and even serve cold dishes.\" \n\nThe Lure of the Perfect Sear \n\nOne cannot discuss the appeal of salt block grilling without mentioning the allure of the perfect sear. On a balmy September night, shadows danced over the McCarthy's deck as scallops sizzled atop the hot pink surface. The seafood edged into a golden-brown crust while leaving the interiors tender and succulent\u2014a textural juxtaposition attributed to the block's even heating surface. \n\n\"Salt blocks reach higher surface temperatures than most grilling surfaces,\" says local chef Elena Torres, who began incorporating salt block techniques into her repertoire in late 2023. \"This makes for an iconic sear that's hard to replicate with other methods. Plus, the salt naturally enhances the flavor of whatever you're cooking, from ribeyes to zucchini.\" \n\nExploring Flavor Enhancements \n\nThe blocks don't just cook food; they season it too. The beauty lies in the block's natural ability to impart a delicate saltiness that accentuates the flavors of the foods without overwhelming them. During my conversation with the McCarthys, I learned this is where personal preferences and creativity can harmoniously merge. \n\n\"You'll find that something like a thin slice of watermelon will get just a hint of savory flavor that turns ordinary into exceptional,\" Deirdre revealed as she laid out a palette of fruits and cheeses on a chilled salt block that served as an intriguing centerpiece. \n\nBeyond the Grill: The Chilled Salt Block Experience \n\nSalt block cooking transcends the mere act of grilling; it elegantly drifts into the realm of cold culinary dishes as well. The same block that was searing steaks minutes ago can \u2014 once properly cooled \u2014 become the striking foundation for sashimi or chilled desserts. \n\nI discovered this versatility firsthand when witnessing a dessert demonstration by pastry chef Myles Becker on the 25th of September. \"You haven\u2019t experienced the full potential of strawberries and cream until you've served them on a chilled salt block,\" he said with an infectious grin. \"The subtle infusion of salt\u2014almost imperceptible to the tongue\u2014exalts the natural sweetness of the berries.\" \n\nThe Ritual and Theatre of Salt Block Cooking \n\nThe use of a salt block isn't just a cooking method; it's a ritual and a form of entertainment that can mesmerize a crowd. The spectacle was clear at the McCarthys' cookout. Guests were drawn to the fire's warm glow, engaging with each other, curiously inspecting the\nblock, and participating in the cooking process. \n\n\"There's something inherently communal about grilling on a salt block,\" James McCarthy mused. \"It's an open invitation for people to gather and contribute their own stories to the meal.\" \n\nThe Growing Community of Salt Block Enthusiasts \n\nSince my initial encounter with salt block grilling among the friends and family of the McCarthy household, the community of those enamored with this technique has continued to flourish. Social media groups and forums are brimming with photos and stories of successful (and occasionally disastrous) salt block ventures. Craft markets and kitchen stores are also seeing a notable uptick in sales of the pink slabs, echoing a broader trend. \n\nMoreover, culinary workshops led by chefs like Elena Torres have sprung up, dedicated entirely to the art of cooking with salt blocks. \"People are intrigued,\" she says, \"They want to learn how to harness this ancient technique in their modern kitchens\u2014and they're having an incredible time doing it.\" \n\nSafety and Care for Your Salt Block \n\nSafety is paramount in all forms of cooking, but even more so when dealing with high temperatures and a block of solid salt. The McCarthys stressed the importance of handling the blocks with heat-resistant gloves and allowing for plenty of time for them to cool down post-use. \n\nAs for care, \"treating your salt block right is the key to its longevity,\" states Myles Becker. After use, a salt block should be wiped clean with a moist cloth and gently scrubbed of any food residue. It's essential to avoid drowning it in water, as this can cause the block to dissolve. When stored in a humid-free environment, a salt block can provide years of grilling joy. \n\nThe Joy of Grilling: Stories from Around the Salt Block \n\nEach grill mark on a salt block tells a story\u2014a steak enjoyed to celebrate an anniversary, garden vegetables shared during a family gathering, or even s'mores constructed on a whim during a starlit summer evening. The stories that weave through the wisps of smoke from a hot salt block reflect the joys and communal spirit of cooking.  \n\nFrom beginner to seasoned chef, incorporating a salt block into the grilling repertoire invites an endless array of possibilities. With stories yet to be told, the warmth of the glow from a salt block grill is sure to inspire many to step outside, strike a match, and create unforgettable moments one sear at a time.\nWith testimonies from culinary enthusiasts and a rising trend in backyards and kitchens across the regions, salt block grilling stands out, not just as a cooking technique, but as a festive ode to our ancestral roots\u2014a touchstone that connects the fire-lit tales of the past to the radiant gatherings of the present.\n",
